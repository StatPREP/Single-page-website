# A Single-page Website

This repository is a template for a single-page website that you can maintain directly from your GitHub account.

- All content goes in the `docs/` directory.
- Edit the file `docs/index.md` to change the page. Use Markdown to organize the page.
- To change the banner, find an image you prefer, upload it to the `docs/images/` directory, and change the top lines of `docs/index.md` to correspond to the name of your new image.
- test.csv contains Age and Occupations.
- This file you are reading right now is not in the `docs/` directory and so is not part of the content of your website.
